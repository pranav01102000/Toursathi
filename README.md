CSS3 is a language that describes the style of the overall systems design. This language
is used to style the contents of the HTML5 element of this system. I can easily use this
to style my project interface that which colour, and position of a content, element. I also
use the CSS3 framework that is Bootstrap. I used this framework mainly for the mobile
view of the project. Also the main purpose of using bootstrap that what the system will
be looking when the system is varied from device to device. Bootstrap is an open-source
toolkit for developing with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Quickly prototype your
ideas or build your entire app with our Sass Page 25 variables and mix INS, responsive
grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery. After
adding some classes to existing elements in the HTML5-code and altering some CSS3
code such as removing some values for width given in pixels the site was changing
depending on the width of the window.

4.3.3 JavaScript:
JavaScript is a versatile programming language commonly used in web development. It
allows for dynamic and interactive elements on websites, enhancing the user experience.
With JavaScript, developers can manipulate webpage content, handle events like button
clicks or form submissions, and create animations and visual effects. It is also utilized
for data validation, form validation, and client-side data processing. JavaScript runs on
the client-side, meaning it is executed by the user's web browser, which eliminates the
need for server requests for every action. Its flexibility, wide range of libraries and
frameworks, and seamless integration with HTML and CSS make JavaScript a powerful
tool for creating engaging and interactive web applications.

4.4 Implemented Tools and Platform:
Implemented tools and platforms are those that I have used to successfully finish my
project in time. This also describes which IDE server that I have used in my project.

4.4.1 IDE:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular and highly regarded integrated development
environment (IDE) widely used for PHP development, including Codeigniter projects.
With its lightweight nature and extensive feature set, VS Code offers a seamless and
efficient development experience. The IDE provides essential features such as syntax
highlighting and code completion, making it easier to write PHP and Codeigniter code
with accuracy. Additionally, VS Code offers an integrated terminal that allows
developers to execute commands and manage virtual environments without leaving the
IDE. Debugging support is also built-in, enabling developers to set breakpoints, step
through code, and inspect variables to troubleshoot and resolve issues effectively.
Another notable feature is the seamless Git integration, enabling developers to manage
version control within the IDE. The availability of a vast library of extensions and
plugins further enhances the functionality of VS Code for PHP and Codeigniter
development. Overall, Visual Studio Code provides a user-friendly, versatile, and
productive environment for PHP and Codeigniter developers, making it a preferred
choice for many in the development community.

4.4.2 Framework: code igniter

4.4.3 Database:
         Codeigniter supports SQLite as one of its database back ends, providing a lightweight
and easy-to-use option for development and testing purposes. SQLite is a server less,
file-based relational database management system that does not require a separate
database server to run. It stores the database as a single file, making it convenient for
small to medium-sized applications.
When using Codeigniter with SQLite, the database configuration is specified in the
settings.py file of the Codeigniter project. By default, Codeigniter is already configured
to use SQLite, so minimal setup is required. You can specify the location and name of
the SQLite database file in the settings file.
SQLite offers several advantages when used with Codeigniter. First, it is a selfcontained database system, 
which means you don't need to install or configure anyexternal database server software. 
This simplifies the setup process and reduces dependencies.
